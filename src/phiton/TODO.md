# TODO

## Phase 1

1. Make CLI work with Fire. 
2. CLI should take an --input path or else read from stdin. 
3. CLI should take an --output path or else write to stdout. 
4. CLI should take a --decompress flag. If provided, it should convert from Phiton to Python. If not provided, it should convert from Python to Phiton. 

## Phase 2

5. We could add support for more complex patterns with multiple statements
6. We could add support for nested pattern matching
7. We could add support for more library-specific patterns (numpy, pandas, etc.)
8. We could add support for custom pattern definitions via configuration
